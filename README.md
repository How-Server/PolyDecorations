# PolyFactory
Ever wanted to play with tech mods, but people you play with don't want to install them? 
Or maybe you are making a server, but vanilla gameplay isn't enough? If so, this project 
will be ideal for you!

PolyFactory is Fabric (and Quilt) server side modification powered by 
[Polymer](https://modrinth.com/mod/polymer) which adds new mechanics, blocks and tools allowing 
for further automation, processing and storage 
(or in simpler terms, it's a tech mod)!

Use Grinders, Mechanical Presses and Mechanical Mixers to process items into different, likely more
useful or compact items, transport them with lines of Conveyors and sort them out with Item Splitters
and Funnels into their own respective Wooden Containers. Just remember to create a Windmill 
or Steam Engine, as using Hand Crank for everything isn't ideal.
Then, if you think you are done with machinery, you can use some Item Readers, Item Counters
connected to Nixie Tubes via colored Cables to display information in a nice and visible way!

You don't know how to start? Use advancements and recipe book/[Polydex](https://modrinth.com/mod/polydex)
for help, as they should guide you through the mod!

## Extra mods you might want to use!
### Polydex
While not necessarily required, it's highly recommended to install [Polydex](https://modrinth.com/mod/polydex), as it allows
you to view all recipes in a simple interface. PolyFactory has full support for them,
with a shortcut button in all crafting station.

### Polymer AutoHost
Simplest way to handle automatic resource pack generation for your server!
While bundled by main distribution of [Polymer](https://modrinth.com/mod/polymer), it requires some manual
setup to work correctly. But it is quick and simple!
