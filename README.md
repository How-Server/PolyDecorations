# PolyDecorations
Ever wanted to play with tech mods, but people you play with don't want to install them? 
Or maybe you are making a server, but vanilla gameplay isn't enough? If so, this project 
will be ideal for you!

PolyFactory is Fabric (and Quilt) server side modification powered by 
[Polymer](https://modrinth.com/mod/polymer) which adds new mechanics, blocks and tools allowing 
for further automation, processing and storage 
(or in simpler terms, it's a tech mod)!

### Polymer AutoHost
Simplest way to handle automatic resource pack generation for your server!
While bundled by main distribution of [Polymer](https://modrinth.com/mod/polymer), it requires some manual
setup to work correctly. But it is quick and simple!
