# PolyDecorations
Wanted to decorate your world bit more? Add some sign posts directing through the world,
some benches in the park to sit on or shelves in your house to put items on? 

PolyDecorations is Fabric (and Quilt) server side modification powered by 
[Polymer](https://modrinth.com/mod/polymer) which multiple decorative blocks such as wooden benches,
shelves, sign posts and braziers! It's ideal to add to server you play with your friends,

This mod was heavily inspired by [Aurora's Decorations](https://modrinth.com/mod/aurorasdecorations) mod,
which you should try out/use instead if you aren't looking for server side mod!

## Extra mods you might want to use!

### Polymer AutoHost
Simplest way to handle automatic resource pack generation for your server!
While bundled by main distribution of [Polymer](https://modrinth.com/mod/polymer), you need to enable it by hand
as it will be otherwise disabled. But it is quick and simple!

### Armor Stand Editor
The bestâ„¢ server side pose editor for Armor Stand (and by extension, Statues!). Highly suggested for better customizability!

### PolyFactory
The first of my mods in this style! But instead being purely decorative, it adds some functional stuff, new crafting stations
and automation. [Checkout Modrinth page for more information!](https://modrinth.com/mod/polyfactory)
